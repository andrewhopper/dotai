## Dot AI is draft standard for creating and managing context in AI coding projects.

Dot AI provides a tool-agnostic way to create and manage context when coding AI projects. It establishes a standardized structure for project documentation, development workflows, and validation processes, enabling more effective collaboration between developers and AI tools.

The framework includes a structured development workflow that guides projects from initialization through feature development and validation, ensuring consistent quality and comprehensive documentation.

## Goals

1. Provide context to accelerate project velocity while maintaining software quality.
2. Solve for cases where AI re-implements basic features like auth or middlware.
3. Solve for cases where AI uses the wrong commands due to outdated documentation (e.g. shadcn-ui vs. shadcn@ or NextJS App Router).
4. Create a self documenting, self correcting systems which clear and testable acceptance and validation criteria.

## Workflow Overview
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Step 1: Bootstrap Project] --> B[Step 2: Define Context]
    B --> C[Step 3: Document Feature]
    C --> D[Step 4: Implement Feature]
    D --> E[Step 5: Validate Standards]
    E --> F{Validation Passed?}
    F -->|No| G[Step 7: Revise Feature]
    G --> E
    F -->|Yes| H[Step 6: Validation Report]
    H --> I[Step 8: Compliance Review]
    I --> J[Feature Complete]
    J -.-> C[Start Next Feature]
```


This workflow ensures that all features are properly documented, implemented according to standards, and validated before being considered complete. Each step includes preflight and post-flight hooks that automate validation against established facts and standards.

## How can I use this?

Fill out your project details in the various folders.  Drop the .cursorrules/.clinerules prompts into your system project, root dir, or settings.  Then Cursor/Cline will refer to these requirements and automatically document your project.

# CLI Installation

Show hidden files on OS X

```
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true
killall Finder
```

```
git clone git@github.com:andrewhopper/dotai.git
cd dotai
npm install # install the packages
npm install -g . # install the CLI globally
```

# CLI Usage
```
switch to your project dir
e.g. cd ~/dev/proj1
dotai init # this will allow you interactively configure your project
```

## Directory Structure

The `.ai` directory serves as a standardized location for AI-related context, documentation, and resources. This structure helps maintain consistent organization across projects and enables AI tools to easily locate and utilize project context.

## Roadmap

- Create NPM CLI to configure repos for AI
- Create MCP server to manage and maintain context
- Create NPM CLI that will walk users through configuring their apps
- Create implementation plans for each feature with an impact/risk metrics and then adjust levels of human guidance based on the expected risk associated with a set of proposed changes.
