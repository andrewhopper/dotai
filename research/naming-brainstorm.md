# Naming Brainstorm for AI-Native SDLC Framework

## Current Working Name
**AI-Native SDLC** - Safe but generic

---

## Top Candidates

### 1. **Bounded Iterative Vibing (BIV)** ⭐ LEADING CANDIDATE
*"Vibe at machine speed. Stay within the bounds."*

**Why it works:**
- "Bounded" = THE key differentiator (ADRs, Locks, Gates prevent chaos)
- "Iterative" = Maturity progression (prototype-alpha → production-rc)
- "Vibing" = Relatable, captures the AI-assisted feel
- Strong acronym: BIV

### 2. **Vibe with Guides** ⭐ NEW IDEA
*"Vibing freedom with architectural guides (ADRs, Locks, Gates)"*

**Why it works:**
- Simple, memorable, approachable name
- "Guides" = ADRs provide steering input (not rigid rules)
- Balances freedom ("vibe") with structure ("guides")
- Less corporate than "governed", less restrictive than "bounded"
- Easy to explain: "Like having senior architects guide your AI agents"
- Natural metaphor: guides help you navigate without restricting exploration

### 3. **Agile Vibe Coding (AVC)** ⭐ NEW IDEA
*"Agile methodology meets AI-accelerated vibing"*

**Why it works:**
- Connects to established agile practices (sprints, retrospectives, adaptive planning)
- "Agile" signals iterative, adaptive approach familiar to dev teams
- Appeals to organizations already using agile/scrum
- Strong acronym: AVC
- Professional yet still relatable
- Positioning: "Agile for the AI era"

### 4. **Self-Refining Vibe Coding** ⭐
*"Vibe coding that refines itself through maturity stages"*

**Why it works:**
- Emphasizes the self-improvement aspect
- Maturity gates auto-tighten as project matures
- LLM-as-Judge provides feedback for refinement
- Agent review catches issues before human review
- Context Refresh keeps information current
- "Self-refining" captures the progressive rigor increase

**Self-Refining Mechanisms:**
1. **Maturity Progression**: prototype-alpha (0% tests) → production-rc (90% tests) - automatically refines quality bar
2. **LLM-as-Judge**: Visual testing provides feedback → agent auto-fixes minor issues
3. **Agent Review**: Multi-agent validation catches 80% of issues → refines before human review
4. **Context Refresh**: Detects stale patterns, breaking changes → refines implementation approach
5. **ADR Evolution**: Proposed → Accepted → Superseded - architectural decisions refine over time
6. **Lock Tightening**: Minimal locks (prototype) → Maximum locks (mission-critical) - protection refines
7. **Code Pattern Extraction**: Learns from past implementations → refines future approaches

### 5. **Guardrailed Iterative Vibing (GIV)**
*"Vibe coding with guardrails: ADRs, Locks, Gates"*

**Why it works:**
- "Guardrailed" more explicit than "bounded"
- Same structure as BIV
- More visual/concrete imagery

### 6. **Governed Iterative Vibing (GIV)**
*"AI governance meets iterative development"*

**Why it works:**
- "Governed" sounds more enterprise-friendly
- Appeals to compliance-minded organizations
- Professional while keeping "vibing"

### 7. **Architected Vibing (AV)**
*"Vibing with architectural consistency"*

**Why it works:**
- Short and punchy
- Emphasizes architectural consistency (ADRs)
- Still relatable
