# Naming Brainstorm for AI-Native SDLC Framework

## Current Working Name
**AI-Native SDLC** - Safe but generic

---

## Top Candidates

### 1. **Bounded Iterative Vibing (BIV)** ⭐ LEADING CANDIDATE
*"Vibe at machine speed. Stay within the bounds."*

**Why it works:**
- "Bounded" = THE key differentiator (ADRs, Locks, Gates prevent chaos)
- "Iterative" = Maturity progression (prototype-alpha → production-rc)
- "Vibing" = Relatable, captures the AI-assisted feel
- Strong acronym: BIV

### 2. **Guardrailed Iterative Vibing (GIV)**
*"Vibe coding with guardrails: ADRs, Locks, Gates"*

**Why it works:**
- "Guardrailed" more explicit than "bounded"
- Same structure as BIV
- More visual/concrete imagery

### 3. **Governed Iterative Vibing (GIV)**
*"AI governance meets iterative development"*

**Why it works:**
- "Governed" sounds more enterprise-friendly
- Appeals to compliance-minded organizations
- Professional while keeping "vibing"

### 4. **Self-Refining Vibe Coding** ⭐ NEW IDEA
*"Vibe coding that refines itself through maturity stages"*

**Why it works:**
- Emphasizes the self-improvement aspect
- Maturity gates auto-tighten as project matures
- LLM-as-Judge provides feedback for refinement
- Agent review catches issues before human review
- Context Refresh keeps information current
- "Self-refining" captures the progressive rigor increase

**Self-Refining Mechanisms:**
1. **Maturity Progression**: prototype-alpha (0% tests) → production-rc (90% tests) - automatically refines quality bar
2. **LLM-as-Judge**: Visual testing provides feedback → agent auto-fixes minor issues
3. **Agent Review**: Multi-agent validation catches 80% of issues → refines before human review
4. **Context Refresh**: Detects stale patterns, breaking changes → refines implementation approach
5. **ADR Evolution**: Proposed → Accepted → Superseded - architectural decisions refine over time
6. **Lock Tightening**: Minimal locks (prototype) → Maximum locks (mission-critical) - protection refines
7. **Code Pattern Extraction**: Learns from past implementations → refines future approaches

### 5. **Architected Vibing (AV)**
*"Vibing with architectural consistency"*

**Why it works:**
- Short and punchy
- Emphasizes architectural consistency (ADRs)
- Still relatable
